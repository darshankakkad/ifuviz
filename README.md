Interested in a simple fitting code that models OIII, Hbeta, NII, Halpha and SII emission lines in an IFS data cube? You are at the right place. The python code here provides a very basic fitting routine that does a simple Gaussian fit to these optical emission lines in an IFS data cube. The code has been adapted specifically for MUSE.
