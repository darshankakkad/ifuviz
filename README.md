Interested in a simple fitting code that models OIII, Hbeta, NII, Halpha and SII emission lines in an IFS data cube, without really the need of installing several packages and struggling with the installation? You are at the right place. The python code here provides a very basic fitting routine that does a simple Gaussian fit to these optical emission lines in an IFS data cube. The code has been adapted specifically for MUSE and is meant to get a first look at a cube (or even for publication if it is a simple fit that you are looking for).
